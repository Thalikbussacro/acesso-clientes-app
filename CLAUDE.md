## Project Overview

This appears to be a client access application project (`acesso-clientes-app`). The repository is currently empty or newly initialized.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, common setup commands will need to be determined based on the technology stack chosen. Update this section once the project structure is established.

## Architecture

The project architecture will be documented here as the codebase develops.

## Notes

- This is a fresh repository - project structure and development commands need to be established
- Update this file with specific build, test, and development commands once the project is set up
